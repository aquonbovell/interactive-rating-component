## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS transitions
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow
- Live Sass Compiler

### What I learned

I learned how to add interactivity using vanilla javascript by listening for events, which was a bit difficult at first, but I am now more confident in my ability to use javascript to add a bit of flare.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about sass partials, mixins and functions to create websites and improve maintainability on bigger projects

### Useful resources

- [Check if an Element does not exist in the DOM using JS](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-check-if-element-does-not-exist) - This helped me for preventing the access to the dom for which there is no element. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
